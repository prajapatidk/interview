What Are Props in Vue.js?
In Vue.js, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props enable component communication and allow a parent to provide inputs or configuration to its child components. They are one-way bindings, meaning the data flows from the parent to the child, ensuring the child component cannot directly modify the parent's data.
